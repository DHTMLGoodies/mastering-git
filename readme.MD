# Mastering GIT

The best way to learn git is to use the command line. Use ui tools
later once you mastered the basics.

## The four areas

1. The working area - file system for your project
2. The index 
3. The repository - the .git folder
4. The stash

### The two questions

1. How does a specific git command move information acrosse the
four areas?
2. How does this command change the repository?

### The repository

Stored in .git

Contains blobs (files), trees (folders) and commits. 

These are 
- immutable, they can be deleted but never changed. 
- linked together

Commits
- is a snapshot
- each commit points to a parent commit(s)
- a branch points to a commit

HEAD
- can only be one HEAD
- HEAD is pointing to a branch


## The index

- unique to Git
- between the working area and the repository
- also called the staging area
- stage to staging area and commit to repository
- data stored in .git/index (binary)

```
git status
nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

means that the file system, index and repository
are the same.

```
git diff
```

compares the working area with the index.

```
git diff --cached
````

compares the index with the repository.


## Moving data to the right

Working Area -> Index -> Repository

1) Make changes to file "menu.txt"
2) git add "menu.txt" to move it to the index
3) git commit -m "Updated menu" to move it from index to repository

## Moving data to the left

Happens in
- git checkout branch (moves HEAD to new branch)

git checkout updates the HEAD to point to a different commit
It also updates the working area and the index

## Compare branches

```
git diff branch1 branch2
````


## git rm

1. Create new file COPYRIGHT.txt
2. git add COPYRIGHT.txt

the file is now in the working area and the index, but not in
the repository.

```
git rm --cached COPYRIGHT.txt
```

will remove the file from the index but keep it in the working area

```
git rm -f COPYRIGHT.txt
```

will remove the file from both the index and the working area.
